angelsaddons-cab=Crawler Autonomous Base (C.A.B.)

[tips-and-tricks-description]
angelsaddons-cab=The highly experimental crawler is an drivable vehicle that can draw and provide power to a network. This can allow for a temporary mobile crafting site while out exploring the map. More features are planned.
angelsaddons-cab-notes=\n\n[font=default-bold]NOTES[/font]: To operate simply set the vehicle in deployed mode to provide the power to the network the vehicle is residing in.\nPower may be supplied by mobile generators or specialised charged batteries.
