[technology-description]
angels-plutonium-power=All that is required to use up excess uranium-238. Convert it to plutonium-240 through breeder cycles.
angels-thorium-power=All that is required to use thorium-based power cycles. If you have excess plutonium-240 or curium-245, you may as well get an energy boost.
angels-fusion-power=All that is required to seed and maintain fusion power through the use of muons and deuterium.
