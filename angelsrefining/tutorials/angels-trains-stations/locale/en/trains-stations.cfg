intro=The goal of this tutorial is to show how to use train stops and schedules to set up transportation of ore between mines and furnaces.

place-stop=Build the train stop at the indicated position.

place-locomotive=Build the locomotive at the train stop.
place-locomotive-info=When near a train stop and in the correct orientation, the locomotive will snap to the stop position.

place-wagon=Build the cargo wagon behind the locomotive.
place-wagon-info=The wagon will show connection indicators when it can be connected correctly to the locomotive.
